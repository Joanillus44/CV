Project Analysis

## User Profile
This website was created to showcase the professional profile of Jan López Carré, a Full-Stack Developer and Designer with experience in both front-end and back-end web development. The target audience includes potential employers, recruiters, and freelance clients seeking a versatile professional capable of delivering technically robust and visually refined digital products. The defined user persona represents a visitor who values simplicity, visual clarity, and intuitive navigation. Typically, these users are professionals from the technology or creative industries who expect to find clear information about experience, education, skills, and projects within a few clicks. The project’s main objective is to present Jan as a competent and reliable professional while conveying his personality and design sensibility through a structured and accessible online portfolio.

## Information Architecture
The website follows a single-page architecture to ensure fluid navigation and a coherent browsing experience. Content is organized into distinct, clearly labeled sections that can be accessed through a fixed navigation menu located at the top of the page. The layout progresses logically from introduction to contact, creating a natural reading flow. The hero section introduces Jan’s name and role, immediately establishing identity and expertise. The experience and education sections are arranged chronologically to present a professional and academic trajectory. The skills section groups content into technical, soft, and language competencies, distributed in a balanced two-column layout for clarity and hierarchy. The projects section displays selected works with visual previews, descriptions, and external links for further exploration. Finally, the contact section includes personal information, location, social media profiles, and a short paragraph inviting collaboration. This architecture facilitates quick access to relevant content while maintaining a professional and cohesive structure across all devices.

## Visual Design
The visual design adopts a minimalist and modern aesthetic aligned with current professional web design standards. The dark background (#0a0a0a) provides a neutral canvas that enhances readability and allows key elements to stand out. A vibrant yellow accent (#f4e542) is strategically used to emphasize titles, section headings, and call-to-action elements, creating a strong contrast that guides the viewer’s attention. The typographic system is based on the Inter sans-serif family, chosen for its clarity, versatility, and readability across digital devices. The layout employs grid-based organization with balanced spacing, ensuring a clean and consistent visual rhythm.
Visual hierarchy is reinforced through large, bold titles and muted secondary text, maintaining focus on essential information such as experience and projects. Interactive elements, such as hover effects and smooth transitions, provide subtle dynamism without compromising usability. Responsiveness has been achieved through media queries, allowing the website to adapt seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile formats. Overall, the design conveys professionalism, precision, and creativity—values that reflect Jan López Carré’s personal brand as a modern web developer and designer.
